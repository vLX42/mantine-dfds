## Usage

In order to import `system` icons you need to include them as follows:

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```jsx
import AccountIcon from '@dfds-ui/icons/system/Account'

<AccountIcon />
```

All other icons can be included as before:

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```jsx
import AccountIcon from '@dfds-ui/icons/Account'

<AccountIcon />
```
