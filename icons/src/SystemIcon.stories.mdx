## Inline icon in text

When using the icons in the system set inlined inside a text it can be tricky to prevent the line height from changing
while still having the icons match the size of the rest of the text. Using the `inline` prop to can help if the icons
are used inside a text-block.

  <Story name="Inline">
    <p>
      Lorem Ipsum <SystemIcon icon="ArrowUp" inline /> is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry.
      Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a
      galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also
      the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged.
      <SystemIcon icon="BuFreightShipping" inline /> It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets
      <SystemIcon icon="SupportContact" inline />
      containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including
      versions of Lorem Ipsum.
